console.log('4.The cases that those variables should be used: ')
console.log('"const" is a signal that the identifier won’t be reassigned.');
console.log('"let" is a signal that the variable may be reassigned, such as a counter in a loop, or a value swap in an algorithm. It also signals that the variable will be used only in the block it’s defined in, which is not always the entire containing function.');
console.log('"var" is now the weakest signal available when you define a variable in JavaScript. The variable may or may not be reassigned, and the variable may or may not be used for an entire function, or just for the purpose of a block or loop.');
